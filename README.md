# AngularJS-App

A Todo List web application using AngularJS.

Users can add a task to the todo list by entering a name for the task and a task description in the input box. 

The application will check if the name of the task is already in the todo list. If it is then a red text will appear to notify the user.

Similarly, the application also checks the entered task description to see if it is already in the todo list. A red text will appear to notify the user if it is.

Users can checkmark all the completed tasks and clicking the Clear Complete Tasks button will automatically move the selected tasks into the Completed List.

If for some reason the user has added a duplicate task of the same name, clicking the Remove Duplicate button will remove all the duplicates after the first occurence of the task.

Users can also remove a task by clicking the X button beside the task.

This application is responsive and asychronous.
